# Wave Function Collapse Map Generation Algorithm App
This is an app that is made to implement the wave function collapse map generation algorithm. 
The user will be able to generate maps with v

The app will have both a desktop and mobile versions, but desktop version will be prioritised during developement.
# The Algorithm

(Explanation of the algorithm and the implementation here)

The algorithm should have time complexity of O(n*m), where n is the number of tile types and m in the size of the map.

# TODO
- Saving and loading maps
- Tile color selection
- Tiles generated in random order to prevent streak-like patterns
- Some work on visuals
- Fix UI on mobile
- Look into weighing tile probability based on adjacent tiles (Making the maps less chaotic)
