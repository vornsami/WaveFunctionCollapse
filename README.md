# Wave Function Collapse Map Generation Algorithm App
This is an app that is made to implement the wave function collapse map generation algorithm. 
The user will be able to generate maps with v

The app will have both a desktop and mobile versions, but desktop version will be prioritised during developement.
# The Algorithm

(Explanation of the algorithm and the implementation here)

# TODO
- Saving and loading maps
- More flexible color selection
- Some work on visuals
- Fix UI on mobile
- Look into weighing tile probability
  - Increase chance of a tile appearing based on adjacent tiles (Making the maps less chaotic)

# Known Issues
- Unable to make a tile type not appear adjacent to itself
